	/****************************************************
	 * Implement tree-like structure here. No need for backtracking, so no Erw*, but do need to implement Erw.
	 * Concerns: ways to minimize memory use as tree expands. Depth-first search and only saving best result can maybe help?
	 * To reduce number of permutations at each step, schedule only one course at a time (ie if we have {(c1,e),(c2,e),(c3,e)} our next step will only consider the possible places to schedule c1.
	 ***************************************************
	 * Not sure we actually need this?????? just start with one Problem Instance at the head...
